# Multiscale Electrofacies Analysis Toolbox

This toolbox allows for quick electrofaices analysis of borehole data. The main advantage of the workflow used here:
1. The results are presented at different scales, i.e., hierarchical.
2. The classification is stochastic in nature.

## Dependencies
- Matlab Las Toolbox (MLT) - https://github.com/MosGeo/LasToolbox
