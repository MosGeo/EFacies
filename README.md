# EFacies: Multiscale electrofacies analysis on borhole data

A workflow for stochastic electrofacies classification from borehold depth data.

# How does it work?

The procedure used here involves a number of steps. Different settings can modify the workflow at each step.
1. Preprocessing including normalization
2. Principle component analysis to decorrelate the data
3. Self organizing maps for initial classification
4. Hierarchical clustering to obtain the multiscale classification

# How to run?

Check the main.m file for an example on how to use the code.
